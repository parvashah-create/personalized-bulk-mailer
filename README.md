## About
This project aims to create a custom email sender that will be sent periodically to all the people on the mailing list requesting an on-campus job. The email will contain relevant information about available job positions, application deadlines, and instructions for submitting an application. Our goal is to make the process of finding and applying for on-campus jobs as easy and accessible as possible for students. We hope to encourage more students to take advantage of the many employment opportunities available on campus.
